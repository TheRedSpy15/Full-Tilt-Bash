## Completed scripts
**These will still be updated**
- [x] setupLinux.sh
- [ ] setupTools.sh
- [x] setupLAMP.sh
- [x] trainLoop.sh
- [ ] secureLinux.sh

## setupLinux.sh
Runs commands that should be done after a fresh install of Linux, and properly updating and cleaning packages. Is still useful afterwards too. I use it on a daily bases.

## setupTools.sh
Installs a large arsenal of pentesting tools, that every pentester should have.

## setupLAMP.sh
Setups Apache, My-SQL, and PHP. Will also install a few other useful programs for maintaining a LAMP server.

## trainLoop.sh
Indefinitely runs the 'sl' command. Not a serious script by any means.

## secureLinux.sh
**Might be moved to its own repo... it's that good**

Configures everything automatically to secure Linux, as well as installing a suite of system defense tools. What sets this script apart from all the other security scripts, is that this one is designed to be simple and compatible. But still doing everything and more, that other scripts do.
