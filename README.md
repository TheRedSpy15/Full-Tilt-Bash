# Full-Tilt-Bash
Bash scripts to designed to quickly setup Ubuntu 18.04 and later systems

## Completed scripts
**These will still be updated**
- [x] update.sh
- [ ] setupTools.sh
- [x] setupLAMP.sh
- [x] trainLoop.sh
- [ ] secureLinux.sh

## update.sh
Properly updates a linux machine. Not only does it update packages, it removes old ones, and even updates grub

## setupTools.sh
Installs a large arsenal of pentesting tools, that every pentester should have.

## setupLAMP.sh
Setups Apache, My-SQL, and PHP. Will also install a few other useful programs for maintaining a LAMP server.

## trainLoop.sh
Indefinitely runs the 'sl' command. Not a serious script by any means.

## secureLinux.sh
**Might be moved to its own repo... it's that good**

Configures everything automatically to secure Linux, as well as installing a suite of system defense tools. What sets this script apart from all the other security scripts, is that this one is designed to be simple and compatible. But still doing everything and more, that other scripts do.
