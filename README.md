## Completed scripts
**These will still be updated**
- [x] setupLinux.sh
- [ ] setupTools.sh
- [x] setupLAMP.sh
- [x] trainLoop.sh
- [ ] secureLinux.sh

## setupLinux.sh
Runs commands that should be done after a fresh install of Linux. Is still useful afterwards too. I use it on a daily bases.

## setupTools.sh
Installs important pentesting tools

## setupLAMP.sh
Setups Apache, My-SQL, and PHP.

## trainLoop.sh
Indefinitely runs the 'sl' command. Not a serious script by any means.

## secureLinux.sh
Configures everything automatically to secure Linux. From disabling guest login, to max password attempts, as well as installing anti-virus. This is a very useful script.
